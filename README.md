Aim :
To design and implement a simple, rule-based recommendation system for Tamil films that suggests movies based on user-defined preferences such as genre and preferred actors.

Objectives:
1.Build a Sample Movie Database: Define a small, structured dataset containing popular Tamil movies with attributes like title, genre, and actors. This dataset will serve as the basis for recommendations.

2.Identify User Preferences: Enable the system to accept user-defined preferences, such as a favorite genre and list of actors.

3.Develop a Scoring Mechanism: Create a scoring algorithm to evaluate how closely each movie matches the user’s preferences. This will involve assigning scores for genre matches and actor matches.

4.Implement the Recommendation Algorithm: Use the scoring mechanism to filter and rank movies based on their relevance to the user’s preferences. The system will sort movies by score to determine the best recommendations.

5.Display Recommendations: Present the recommended movies to the user in order of relevance, allowing them to see which movies align most closely with their preferences.

6.Ensure System Flexibility: Allow users to modify their preferences and receive updated recommendations, enhancing the interactive experience.
